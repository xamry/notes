# ETL
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It refers to a process used in data integration and management, particularly in the context of data warehousing and business intelligence.

## Difference between ETL and ELT
1. ETL loads data first into the staging server and then into the target system, whereas ELT loads data directly into the target system.
2. ETL is mainly used for a small amount of data, whereas ELT is used for large amounts of data, such as NoSQL, Hadoop cluster, cloud installation etc.
3. ETL is easy to implement, whereas ELT requires niche skills to implement and maintain.
