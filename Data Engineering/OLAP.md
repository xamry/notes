# OLAP
OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing. It is a technology used in business intelligence systems to analyze and query multidimensional data. OLAP provides a way to organize and manipulate large volumes of data to support complex analysis and decision-making.

# Schema Types
## Star Schema
Star schema is a data warehouse schema where there is only one â€œfact table" and many de-normalized dimension tables. Fact table contains primary keys from all the dimension tables and idwbitraining@gmail.com 6 other statistical columns (facts)
## Snowflake Schema
Unlike Star-Schema, Snowflake schema contain normalized dimension tables in a tree like structure with many nesting levels. Snowflake schema is easier to maintain but queries require more joins.

# Mutidimensional Data Model

## Dimension
A "dimension" is essentially an entry point for getting at the facts. Dimensions are things of interest to the business. Dimensions are a set of level properties that describe a specific aspect of a business, used for analyzing the factual measures.

### Slowly Changing Dimension
Slowly changing dimensions refers to the change in dimensional attributes over time. 

An example of slowly changing dimension is a Resource dimension where attributes of a particular employee change over time like their designation changes or dept changes etc.

#### Types of Slowly Changing Dimension

 1. Type 1:  Update the existing row (no history)
 2. Type 2:  Add a new dimension row (history maintained)
 3. Type 3: Add additional column to maintain history (e.g. prior department)

### Conformed Dimension
Conformed Dimensions (CD): these dimensions are something that is built once in your model and can be reused multiple times with different fact tables. Example: Time dimension

### Junk Dimension
A "junk" dimension is a collection of random transactional codes, flags and/or text attributes that are unrelated to any particular dimension.

### De Generated Dimension
A dimension which is located in fact table is known as Degenerated dimension. There are cases where a dimension attribute is not complex enough to warrant its own dimension table. Instead, it is directly included as an attribute in the fact table. This attribute becomes a degenerated dimension. Example: Transaction ID, Invoice ID etc.

## Fact
A "fact" is a numeric value that a business wishes to count or sum. 

### Fact Table 
A Fact Table in a dimensional model consists of one or more numeric facts of importance to a business. Examples of facts are as follows:  
the number of products sold 
the value of products sold
the number of products produced 
the number of service calls received

### Types of Facts
There are three types of facts: 

#### Additive: 
Additive facts are facts that can be summed up through all of the dimensions in the fact table (Quantity Sold, Dollars Sold) 

#### Semi-Additive: 
Semi-additive facts are facts that can be summed up for some of the dimensions in the fact table, but not the others (Account Balance, Inventory levels) 

#### Non-Additive: 
Non-additive facts are facts that cannot be summed up for any of the dimensions present in the fact table (Room Temperature)
