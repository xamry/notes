# Data Warehouse
Data Warehouse is a "Subject-Oriented, Integrated, Time-Variant, Nonvolatile collection of data in support of decision making".

Subject Oriented: 
Data that gives information about a particular subject instead of about a company's ongoing operations. 

Integrated: Data that is gathered into the data warehouse from a variety of sources and merged into a coherent whole. 

Time-variant: 
All data in the data warehouse is identified with a particular time period. 

Non-volatile: Data is stable in a data warehouse. More data is added but data is never removed.
