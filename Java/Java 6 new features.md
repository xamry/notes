# Java 6 New Features

## Scripting API: 
Java 6 introduced the javax.script package, which provides a standard API for embedding and executing scripting languages within Java applications. It allows you to interact with scripting languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.
    
## Compiler API: 
Java 6 introduced the javax.tools package, which provides an API for programmatically invoking the Java compiler. This feature allows developers to dynamically compile and load Java source code at runtime.
    
## JDBC 4.0: 
Java 6 included an updated version of the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API. JDBC 4.0 introduced several new features, including automatic driver loading, better support for BLOB and CLOB data types, and improved handling of SQL exceptions.   
    
## Console Input: 
Java 6 added the System.console() method, which provides a way to interact with the console for reading input and writing output. It simplifies console-based user interactions in command-line applications.
