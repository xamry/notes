# Java 6 New Features
1.  Scripting API: Java 6 introduced the javax.script package, which provides a standard API for embedding and executing scripting languages within Java applications. It allows you to interact with scripting languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.
    
2.  Compiler API: Java 6 introduced the javax.tools package, which provides an API for programmatically invoking the Java compiler. This feature allows developers to dynamically compile and load Java source code at runtime.
    
3.  JDBC 4.0: Java 6 included an updated version of the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API. JDBC 4.0 introduced several new features, including automatic driver loading, better support for BLOB and CLOB data types, and improved handling of SQL exceptions.
    
4.  Pluggable Annotations: Java 6 introduced the ability to define and process pluggable annotations through the use of the javax.annotation package. This feature allows developers to create custom annotations and write tools that process them at compile time.
    
5.  Improved GUI Toolkit: Java 6 included various enhancements to the Swing GUI toolkit. It introduced performance improvements, improved support for custom look and feel, enhancements to the JTable component, and improved support for drag and drop.
    
6.  Java Compiler API: Java 6 introduced the javax.tools.JavaCompiler API, which allows you to compile Java source code programmatically. This feature enables dynamic code generation and compilation at runtime.
    
7.  Console Input: Java 6 added the System.console() method, which provides a way to interact with the console for reading input and writing output. It simplifies console-based user interactions in command-line applications.
    
8.  Java SE 6 HotSpot JVM: Java 6 included the HotSpot JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which provided significant performance improvements over previous versions. The HotSpot JVM included various optimizations such as escape analysis, improved garbage collection, and performance enhancements for multi-core processors.
    

These are some of the notable features introduced in Java 6. It's important to note that newer versions of Java have been released since Java 6, and they introduced additional features and improvements beyond Java 6.
