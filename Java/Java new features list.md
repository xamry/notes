# Java 7 New Features
## String in Switch
Java 7 introduced the ability to use strings in the switch statement. Prior to Java 7, only integral types (such as int, char, byte) were allowed as switch expressions.

## Diamond Operator
Also called type inference for generic instance creation, was introduced in Java 7. It allows you to omit the type parameters when creating an instance of a generic class if the compiler can infer the type from the context.
