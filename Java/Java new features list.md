# Java 7 New Features

## String in Switch
We can now use strings in the switch statement. Earlier, only primitive types and enumerated types were allowed as switch expressions.

## Diamond Operator
Also called type inference for generic instance creation. It allows you to omit the type parameters when creating an instance of a generic class if the compiler can infer the type from the context.

## Try-with-resources (Automatic resource management)
You can declare resources within the try statement, and the JVM will automatically close those resources when they are no longer needed, even if an exception occurs. The resources that should be auto closed must implement `java.lang.AutoCloseable interface

## Improved Exception Handling
