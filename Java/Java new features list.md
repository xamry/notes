# Java 7 New Features

## String in Switch
We can now use strings in the switch statement. Earlier, only primitive types and enumerated types were allowed as switch expressions.

## Diamond Operator
Also called type inference for generic instance creation. It allows you to omit the type parameters when creating an instance of a generic class if the compiler can infer the type from the context.

## Try-with-resources
You can declare resources within the try statement, and the JVM will automatically close those resources when they are no longer needed, even if an exception occurs.
