Agile Methodologies:
===========================
- Scrum
- Crystal Methodologies
- DSDM (Dynamioc Software Development Method)
- FDD (Feature Driven Development)
- Lean Software Development
- XP (Extreme Programming)

Estimation
==============

Based on
-------
- Past data/ experience
- Available document/ knowledge
- Assumptions
- Identified risks

Steps for estimation:
-------
1. Size
2. Effort
3. Schedule
4. Cost


Decomosition Technique (Divide and conquer approach) - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/estimation_techniques/estimation_techniques_quick_guide.htm
-------------------
Step 1 - Understand Scope
Step 2 - Calculate estimate of size
	1. Read SOW (Scope of work)
	2. Decompose into functions until you can't calculate size.
	3. Calculate size of each function.
	4. Calculate effort and cost by applying size to baseline productivity
	5. Combine the results for overall project estimate
Step 3 - Calculate estimate of effort and cost
	1. Identify activities
	2. Decompose activities into tasks that can be measured
	3. Estimate effort for each task
	4. Combine task estimates to produce activity estimate
	5. Compute Activity cost by multiplying effort * (Cost per unit effort)
	6. Combine activity effort/ cost tp produce overall effort/ cost
Step 4 - Investigate whether and why the Step 2 and Step 3 efforts diverge
Step 5 - Find the cause of divergence and reconcile the estimates.

Remember:
- Collect estimate from multiple developers and/or using multiple techniques
- Developer estimate is most accurate
- Assume 80% productivity
- Include management time/ contingency time.
- With estimate. document assumptions, risk, uncertainty
- Negotiate on scope if there is a schedule constraint


Function Point Analysis (FPA)
--------------------------
- FP measure software size to express usiness functionality a software provides to its users.



Leadership Styles:
============
Democratic Leadership
Autocratic Leadership
Laissez-Faire Leadership (No intereference)
Strategic Leadership
Transformational Leadership
Transactional Leadership
Coach-Style Leadership
Bureaucratic Leadership

5 phases of project lifecycle:
==============================
Initiation
Planning
Execution
Monitoring & Control
Closing


Situations (STAR Method - Situation, Task, Action, Result)
=======================
1. Stressful situation
2. Prioritization when overly tasked/ Behind schedule/ Anything else
3. Conflict at workplace
4. Challenging roject -
5. Managing underperforming resource
6. Dealing when overwhelmed or underperforming
7. Biggest mistake


Pareto Principle - 80/20


Project Management Tools
--------------
1. Gantt Chart
2. WBS
3. PBS (Product Breakdown Structure)
4. PERT Chart
5. Logic Network
