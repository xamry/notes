# Introduction
Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
Scrum is a **lightweight agile** project management **framework**.

## 3 Pillars of Scrum

 - Transparency
 - Inspection
 - Adaptation

## Scrum Values
- commitment
- courage
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect

# Parts of Scrum
- Scrum teams and their associated roles
- Events
- Artifacts
- Rules

## Scrum Teams 
(Scrum Teams are **self-organizing** and **cross-functional**)
- Product Owner  
- Development team  
- Scrum master  

### Product Owner (One person)
- Responsible for maximizing the value of product
- Manages product backlog
- May delegate some work to dev team, but is accountable.

### Development Team
- Self organizing
- cross-functional
- No title
- No sub-teams
- Collective accountability despite having individual specialized skills
- Size: 3-9

### Scrum Master
- Responsible for promoting and supporting scrum as defined in scrum guide

## Scrum Events
(Minimizes need for other meetings, time-boxed)

- Sprint planning (Max 8 hours for 1 month sprint)
- Daily scrum
- Sprint review
- Sprint retrospective

### Sprint Planning
- WHAT can be done in this sprint
- HOW will the chosen work get done.

input
	-> Product backlog
	-> Latest product increment
	-> Projected capacity of development team during print
	-> Past performance of dev team
output
	-> Sprint goal
	-> Sprint backlog (items from product backlog + plan to execute them)

Daily Scrum
---------------------
- 15 minute
- Inspection of progress 
- Only dev team participates
- improves communication
- Eliminates other meetings


Sprint Review
-------------------
- Held at the end of sprint
- Informal meeting, not a status meeting
- Inspects the increment and adapts product backlog
- At most 4-hour for 1-month Sprint
- Key-stakeholders are invited by product owner.
- Output -> Revised product backlog.


Sprint Retrospective
---------------------------
- Sprint team inspects itselfs for improvement, to adapt in upcoming sprints.
- After Sprint review, before next sprint planning
- At most 3 hour long for 1 month sprint
- What went well, what can be improved.
- Create plan for improvements

Scrum Artifacts
---------------------
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Increment

Sprint burndown?

Product Backlog
-------------------
- Product Owner is responsible (including its content, availability and ordering)
- Never complete, always evolving. Dynamic
- Attributes of items: Description, order, estimate, value.
- Higher order items have more clarity and details.
- Items that can be done in one sprint are called "Ready for selection"
- Dev team responsible for estimates

Sprint Backlog
-------------------
- Items from product backlog selected for sprint + plan for delivering the sprint goal.
- Should include at least one high priority process improvement item identified in previous retrospective.
- Continually evolving, Only dev teams can change it during sprint.

Increment
-----------------
- Must be "done", inspectable, useable
- all items completed during the sprint
